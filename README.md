## Background

With the many E-commerce sites scouring the internet, Duy and I wanted to create one that was easy to navigate and provided reliable functionality. 



<hr></hr>

## Features

* Able to add product, storing the information in a database 

<hr></hr>

## Technologies Used

* React -- I decided to use React because of its popularity, making it a relatable library to use when developing an application
* MongoDB -- use to store data in the form of bugs and users created through the application
* Express -- enables connection to the frontend with minimal approach
* HTML, CSS, JSON -- used to create front end form creation script
<hr></hr>

## Usage

The app is used similarly to E-bay or Amazon, in the sense that you can make purchases while tracking those purchases. You may also upload your own products to be surveyed and bought on the app.

<hr></hr>

## Project Status

Mostly clickable prototype is completed, backend developement implemented but not currently functional. CSS developed on most of the pages. Backend created for adding a product to the page.

<hr></hr>

## Room for Improvement

* Code will be tested more frequently to ensure less mistakes in the future
* Folders and files will be organized in a more concise manner
* Communication will be handled more professionally 

<hr></hr>

## Acknowledgement

My friend Duy and I collectively decided to work on this project in order to have a solid project under our belts.
Duy approached a bulk of the CSS when we started the front-end developement.
